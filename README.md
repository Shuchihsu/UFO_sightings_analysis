# UFO_sightings_challenge

## Overview of the analysis

 Dana would like to create a web application in order to show the ufologist the data. We can create the
              application with JavaScript, HTML and .js file.We also create a filter so the people review the data can filter 
              with certain criteria to find their interested areas of UFOs.


### Results

We have five search criteria. We design that people can fill out all the search criteria, a couple of them or fill out none of the columns. 
       If you find yourself can’t see any results after you put the criteria in the search, maybe there is no matching data for the criteria you put in. 
       You just need to loosen up the criteria by putting in just a couple of them or just start with putting one of them and leave the rest blank
       to see what the data returns to you. But remember when the page load, there will be full dataset in front of you.

### Summary

* The drawback: the overall design I think it is great. I don’t think we should take anything out. But I do think we can make the format of the page look prettier. For example, we can give more space between the data and the introduction column on the top.
* Recommendations: some people probably didn’t know they can hit “Enter” and then get the results of their search. We can put a “Search” button to make it more clear how to get the results. Also, the comments are important. Maybe we can design a keyword search just for the comment’s column.
